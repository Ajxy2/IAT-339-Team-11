WHAT WE NEED FOR NEXT WEEK:

A reminder that your company website must satisfy the following content requirements:
	▪ company updates/events
	▪ about the company
	▪ how to contact the company
	▪ a multi-product or multi-service listing
	▪ one product or service detailed view
	▪ the entire process of purchasing a product or service
	▪ appropriate means for the user to provide feedback on a product or service
The list above is not a list of 'pages' required. It provides an overview of the content required in both P01 and P02. Please also keep in mind that this content should be integrated as appropriate for your product or service. Having a user be able to provide feedback will look very different for a specific product as opposed to a service.


My idea for organizing the pages:

• Home page:
	▪ company updates/events
	▪ about the company

• Contact page:
	▪ how to contact the company
	▪ appropriate means for the user to provide feedback on a product or service

• Service listing page:
	▪ a multi-product or multi-service listing
  ▪ pretty much done already?

• One detailed service page:
	▪ one product or service detailed view (clicking one of the services leads you to this)

• Checkout page + cart:
	▪ the entire process of purchasing a product or service
	▪ Mostly done already? I think we just need to link the detailed service page to the cart or something.
